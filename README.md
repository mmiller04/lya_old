# mitlya

Repository of shared routines for the MIT Ly-a team (CMOD and DIII-D).

This collection of routines should be somewhat generalized to help us work across the two devices and eventually build a cross-device database. Routines that fit here might have to do with pedestal/SOL profile fitting, Abel inversions, basic AURORA usage for neutrals, database construction, etc.

git-clone this repo to your home directory and make sure to keep the repo up to date!
